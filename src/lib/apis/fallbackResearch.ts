    abstract: 'This foundational review examines the core concepts and methodologies that define contemporary human geography. The paper explores how geographers study the relationship between people and places, examining spatial patterns of human activity and the processes that create them. We discuss major themes including urbanization, globalization, migration, and environmental change. The methodology combines literature synthesis with case study analysis from five continents. Our findings reveal that digital technologies are transforming how geographers collect and analyze spatial data, while climate change is emerging as a central organizing principle for the discipline.',

    abstract: 'Gender shapes and is shaped by spatial relationships in complex ways. This study examines how gender inequality manifests across different geographic scales, from household spaces to global patterns. Using mixed methods research across 25 countries, we investigate workplace geography, access to public spaces, mobility patterns, and reproductive geography. Our methodology combines spatial analysis with feminist research methods including participatory mapping and in-depth interviews. Findings reveal persistent spatial dimensions of gender inequality, with significant variations based on cultural context, economic development, and government policies.',
